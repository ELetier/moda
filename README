Moda is an R package that provides functions for modelling and solving
multi-objective optimisation problems under uncertainty through
Monte-Carlo simulation and Pareto-based optimisation. It also computes 
the expected value of total and partial perfect information.

The functions in moda are part of our method for supporting software
requirements and architecture decisions described in

E. Letier, David Stefan, and Earl T. Barr, 
Uncertainty, Risk, and Information Value 
in Software Requirements and Architecture,
ICSE 2014.

The package contains the models for the examples given in that paper
(under /inst/examples/ICSE14 in the package sources).
